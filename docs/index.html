  <p>My friend Ranjith asked me if I can help out implementing an alternate authentication system for Common Voice.
Common Voice is a platform for collecting voice dataset for languages other than English.
<a href="https://swecha.org">Swecha</a>, a local organization, wanted to collect voice samples for my native language Telugu through their own self-hosted version of Common Voice.
They will use these voice samples to train LLM models.</p>
<p>It sounded like a nice challenge and a good cause.
So, I agreed and went down a deep rabbit hole.
I will write down all things I encountered as I tried to self-host this application.</p>

  <p>2023 has been a fantastic year for me. I have delivered a lot of projects at
work. My first child was born. I got promoted as a staff software engineer
and a lot more. I want to jot down all the things that I remember as much as I can.</p>

  <p>I maintain a small frontend application (4K LOC) which uses <a href="https://vitejs.dev/">Vite</a> as the compiler. The production build, using
<code>npm run build</code>, was taking 26 secs on Github Actions. It seemed awfully slow for such a small application. I decided to investigate
why.</p>

  <p>I manage the frontend team at Kisi. A new senior software engineer joined us in May.
He is totally up to speed, but we haven&rsquo;t assigned a lot of code review work to
him yet. I want to understand what is the distribution of code reviews and
balance them evenly across my team. You will see how I used ChatGPT as my coding assistant
to generate this data.</p>

  <p>Feature flags allow developers to enable and disable features without making changes to code and re-deploying the application.
I have designed &amp; developed the feature flag system at work for <a href="">https://web.kisi.io</a>. It has been 3 years since I wrote the
first commit, and it&rsquo;s still in production.</p>

  <time datetime="2023-02-04T21:59:33&#43;0530" class="post-date">Sat, Feb 4, 2023</time>
  You can run node server apps in pm2 with ts-node just by simply declaring it as dependency. As always there is a catch, ts-node by default use typescript compiler to typecheck and then run the code. There is way to disable typechecking via tsconfig.json file.
{ &#34;extends&#34;: &#34;ts-node/node16/tsconfig.json&#34;, &#34;ts-node&#34;: { &#34;transpileOnly&#34;: true, &#34;files&#34;: true, &#34;compilerOptions&#34;: {} }, &#34;compilerOptions&#34;: { // typescript options here } } Reference: https://www.npmjs.com/package/ts-node#via-tsconfigjson-recommended
I had assumed ts-node had no way to disable typechecking and looked at tsx instead.

**Note**: You need to have npm@3 installed on your system (macOS or linux). If you
don't have it installed, you can install it using [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)   

This is a short tutorial on how to use Reason with Rebel.

- Start a new npm package by `npm init` it will generate `package.json`
- Install `rebel` using `npm i -S @reason/rebel`
- open a new `src/index.re`
- write `print_line "Hello World";`

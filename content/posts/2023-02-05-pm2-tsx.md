You can run node server apps in `pm2` with `ts-node` just by simply declaring it as dependency.
As always there is a catch, `ts-node` by default use typescript compiler to typecheck and then
run the code. There is way to disable typechecking via tsconfig.json file.

```json
{
  "extends": "ts-node/node16/tsconfig.json",
  "ts-node": {
    "transpileOnly": true,
    "files": true,
    "compilerOptions": {
    }
  },
  "compilerOptions": {
    // typescript options here
  }
}
```

I had assumed `ts-node` had no way to disable typechecking and looked at tsx instead. But there is
a reasonable argument for using tsx if you have large node application since tsx uses esbuild under
the hood.


There are two ways to run a typescript program with tsx.

```sh
tsx index.ts

# or

node --loader tsx index.ts
```


pm2 allows you configure the interpreter it uses run the files. So in `ecosystem.config.js` you can
configure you application as follows


```js
module.exports = {
  apps: [
    {
      name: 'server',
      script: './server/index.ts',
      interpreter: 'tsx',
    },
  ],
};
```

I couldn't get this work locally as tsx needs to be in `PATH` environment variable since I was using volta.
Therefore I turned to the latter style and it works


```js
module.exports = {
  apps: [
    {
      name: 'server',
      script: './server/index.ts',
      interpreter: 'node',
      interpreterArgs: '--loader tsx',
    },
  ],
};
```

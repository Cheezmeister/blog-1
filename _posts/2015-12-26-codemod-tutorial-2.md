### Introduction

After I wrote my last blog post on **How to write a codemod**, I was searching for problems that I can use for this blog post and I remembered about a blog post complaining the Ember 2.0 churn. I felt that codemods would have prevented some of the pain in the upgrading process. So, I wanted to write codemods for ember to show the community that, they can really benefit from codemods. But, the problem, I have absolutely zero knowledge of ember. But somehow, I landed on this [ember deprecations][ember-depr] page and I was immediately excited. It's because they gave the code before deprecation and after deprecation i.e, all we need to do is to write a codemod. I also felt a huge sigh of relief because I don't have to learn a new framework just to write a few codemods.    

In this blog post, we will codemods for two of such deprecations. The first one is extremely simple and second one is slightly more complex and tricky. Let's start!
